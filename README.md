# openfortivm-vpn

Modified [openfortivpn](https://github.com/adrienverge/openfortivpn) client to connect with Fortinet PPP+TLS VPNs. Contains [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) specific modifications for [openfortivm-image](https://github.com/vuhuy/openfortivm-image) to control the dhcpd service. This repository is [built and packaged](https://github.com/vuhuy/openfortivm-image/scripts/build-apk.sh) as an Alpine Package Keeper (APK) package. The [original build instructions](https://github.com/adrienverge/openfortivpn/blob/master/README.md#installing) still works.
